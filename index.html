<a id="1-what-is-recon" class="anchor" href="#1-what-is-recon" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1. What is Recon?</h2>

<p>Recon is an algorithm for generating a description of a population
from a sample (see Section 2, Terminology).</p>

<p>More precisely, it uses the distribution of species counts in a sample
to estimate the distribution of species sizes in the population from
which the sample was drawn.</p>

<p>It:</p>

<ul>
<li>assumes nothing about the frequency distribution of species in
the population,</li>
<li>avoids (over)fitting of sampling noise,</li>
<li>scans many starting points in an attempt to find a global best
fit, and</li>
<li>outputs error bars for the number of species of a given size in
the population.</li>
</ul>

<p>The code provided in this directory:</p>

<ul>
<li>given species frequencies observed in a sample, determines the
maximum-likelihood species frequency distribution of the
population without overfitting (see Section 4, Running Recon),</li>
<li>outputs diversity measurements for the population (see Section
5, Diversity measures),</li>
<li>allows new error bar calculations (see Section 6, Error bars),
and</li>
<li>performs power calculations of the sample size required to be
able to detect a given difference between two samples (see
Section 7, Power calculations).</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="2-requirements" class="anchor" href="#2-requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2. Requirements</h2>

<p>recon.py requires Python 2.7 (<a href="https://www.python.org">https://www.python.org</a>) and the SciPy
Python library (<a href="http://scipy.org">http://scipy.org</a>). We have tested it on Macintosh OS
X Lion and Yosemite.</p>

<h2>
<a id="3-terminology" class="anchor" href="#3-terminology" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3. Terminology</h2>

<p>A <strong>species</strong> is group made up of one or more <strong>individuals.</strong> The number
of individuals of a given species is that species' <strong>size.</strong> A <strong>sample</strong>
is a set of individuals from one or more species that is drawn
randomly from a <strong>population.</strong> Species represented in the population
that are not represented in the sample are called <strong>missing species.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Diversity</strong> refers to any of a set of measures of the frequency
distribution in the population. They can be thought of as effective
numbers of species in the population. The <strong>Hill numbers</strong> (<strong>qD,</strong> read
"D-q") are a family of diversity measures defined by the parameter q,
which determines the degree to which diversity measures are weighted
toward larger species. For example, 0D is <strong>species richness,</strong> a
diversity measure that weights all species equally (and so is just a
count of the number of different species). infD is the reciprocal of
the Berger-Parker Index, the effective number of species if all
species were the size of the largest species. Simple mathematical
transformations of Shannon entropy (q=1), Gini-Simpson Index (q=2),
and other common diversity measures correspond to different Hill
numbers.</p>

<h3>
<a id="description" class="anchor" href="#description" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Description</h3>

<p>Given a set of observations of species frequency in the sample,
outputs a set of parameters that describe the maximum-likelihood
species frequency distribution in the parent population, without
overfitting.</p>

<h3>
<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h3>

<p>python recon.py [-c -d BIN_SIZE -l PARAMETER_LIMIT -t THRESHOLD -v -r]
FILE_OUT DATA_FILE</p>

<h3>
<a id="example" class="anchor" href="#example" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example</h3>

<pre><code>python recon.py -l 10 -t 30 test.out recon_test_data.txt
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a id="output" class="anchor" href="#output" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Output</h3>

<p>A fit file with parameters that describe the parent population.
Diversity measurements for the population can be output and displayed
from this file (see section 5, Displaying results). These parameters
are called "weights" and "means." The weights w_j give the proportion
of species in the population that have j individuals. The means are
Poisson parameters; they give the mean number of individuals a species
of size j contributes to the sample.</p>

<h3>
<a id="required-parameters" class="anchor" href="#required-parameters" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Required parameters</h3>

<p>FILE_OUT    the filename to be used for output. Note that if this file
exists it will not be overwritten; instead, recon will
exit with an error message.</p>

<p>DATA_FILE   a text file containing the number of individuals of each
species seen in the sample (i.e., the species sizes in the
sample).</p>

<p>The default format is a tab-delimited file with lines of
the form</p>

<p>species name  species size</p>

<p>with a newline character delimiting lines. Species size is
an integer. Sample data in this format can be found in the
file recon_test_data.txt; in it, species1 has 1
individual, species2 has 1 individual, etc. up to
species100; species 101 has 2 individuals, etc.</p>

<h3>
<a id="options" class="anchor" href="#options" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Options</h3>

<p>-c          The -c option allows recon to read an alternative
tab-delimited format with lines of the form</p>

<p>species size  number of species of this size</p>

<p>Both values are integers. Example data in this format can
be found in recon_test_data_distribution_in_file.txt; this
is the same data as in recon_test_data.txt, just in the
alternative format. (Note that Recon does not need species
names.) The number of species of size 1 (i.e., the number
of species with one individual each) in the sample is 100,
the number of species of size 2 is 30, etc.</p>

<p>-d BIN_SIZE (default: 1)
Average number of observations per individual. In many
circumstances, each individual in the sample will be observed
and counted once. However, there are cases where each
individual in the sample will be observed and counted
multiple times. BIN_SIZE allows for this possibility.</p>

<p>-l PARAMETER_LIMIT (default: 20)
The maximum number of parameters that the algorithm will
use to fit the data (default, 20). The recon algorithm
will continue adding parameters until the (corrected)
Akaike Information Criterion indicates that additional
parameters are not justified. In practice the limit of 20
is rarely reached.</p>

<p>-t THRESHOLD (default: 50)
The -t option allows you to modify THRESHOLD, the size
above which sampling error is considered small, which
means that Recon will assume the frequency of species of
this size or greater in the population is the same as the
frequency in the sample. It defaults to 50, but 30 usually
gives good results. This is because if, in a sample from a
well mixed population, species A is seen 30 times in a
sample it is very unlikely that there is another species B
which is the same size as A in the parent population but
is missing or very poorly reperesented in the sample.
Smaller values will give faster run times but less
accurate results.</p>

<p>-v 
The -v option produces verbose output. It will print
the starting and finishing parameters of every step that
recon takes during the fit. This may typically be tens
of thousands of lines.</p>

<p>A table of Hill numbers for the reconstructed distribution, one row
for each input file (see FILE_IN1 below). The columns labelled "obs"
show the Hill numbers from the sample. The columns labeled "MLE"

estimated for the population. Since 0D_MLE is the estimate of the
species richness in the parent population, the estimated missing
species is 0D_MLE - 0D_obs.</p>
